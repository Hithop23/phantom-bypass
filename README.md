# Phantom Bypass Lab

![Phantom Logo](icons/phantom128.png)

**Phantom Bypass Lab** is an ethical tool designed for security testing in payment systems. It allows you to simulate and analyze transactions in controlled environments, helping to identify vulnerabilities and improve the security of payment systems.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🕵️ Network Request Interception**: Captures and modifies HTTP/HTTPS requests related to payment systems.
- **🎭 DOM Bypass**: Dynamically modifies DOM elements to simulate successful or failed transactions.
- **🛡️ Stealth Mode**: Obfuscates the presence of the extension to avoid detection in sensitive environments.
- **📜 Activity Logging**: Saves detailed logs of all operations performed.
- **🖥️ User Interface**: An intuitive popup to control and monitor the extension.

---

## 📌 Requirements

- **Browser**: Google Chrome or any Chromium-based browser (Brave, Edge, etc.).
- **Permissions**: The extension requires permissions to access all URLs (`<all_urls>`), modify network requests, and manipulate the DOM.

## 🔧 Installation

### From Source Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hithop23/phantom-bypass-lab.git
cd phantom-bypass-lab
```

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.

## ⚙️ Usage

### **Activate the Extension**
1. Click the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
2. Use the popup to enable or disable specific modules (network interception, DOM bypass, etc.).

### **Intercept Requests**
1. Navigate to a website with a payment system.
2. The extension will automatically intercept payment-related requests.

### **Modify Transactions**
1. Use the popup options to simulate successful, failed, or custom transactions.

### **View Logs**
- Activity logs are saved in `localStorage` and can be viewed in the browser console or exported from the popup.

## 🔧 Configuration

### **Permissions**

The extension requires the following permissions:

- `scripting`: To execute scripts on web pages.
- `webRequest`: To intercept and modify network requests.
- `storage`: To save logs and configurations.
- `tabs`: To interact with browser tabs.

---

## 🔐 Security Policy

The extension uses a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to ensure security:

```json
{
  "content_security_policy": {
    "extension_pages": "script-src 'self'; object-src 'none'"
  }
}
```
